PROCESS ENGINE using Nodejs and Socket.IO

In this project we are aiming to create a process engine that can some what automate the user's actions and make desicions based 
on them, this project will be divided into two iterations :

1- The first iteration consists of creating an API of some sort that can parse two JSON files, one that contains the global
process defintion, and the other contains the schema, then generate a data file that is based on those two files based on the user's 
input and his way to start the process;
The data file also helps us to keep track of the history : who started the process etc..

Then we implement the API in a Client-server architecture web app that uses Socket.io to call API functions that reside on 
the server side.
And then the users can simply fill out web forms and use simple interfaces to manage his workflow.

2- The 2nd iteration will contain Meta data
